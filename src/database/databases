                                    CSV files
- This file contains data separated by a comma.
- Each ine contains the same sequence of data.
- They are used to import and export data into the database.
- The snippet below exports data into the database.

    LOAD DATA INFILE 'c:/tmp/city.csv'
    INTO TABLE city FIELDS TERMINIATED BY ' , ‘
    ENCLOSED BY ' " ‘
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' IGNORE 1 ROWS;

- The following snippet exports data from a database into the csv file.

    LOAD DATA INFILE 'c:/tmp/city.csv' INTO TABLE city FIELDS
    TERMINIATED BY ' , ‘
    ENCLOSED BY ' " ‘
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' IGNORE 1 ROWS;

                                Database interaction
- There are three wats to interact with databases
            1. Client-server model -applications are created to provide an instrument for interaction between the users
                    and the DBMS interface.
            2.Three-tier applications with web pages - Web users engage in a direct database interaction. Communication occurs
                        on a front-end interface
            3. Embedded application code.

                    Transactions
- They represent reproduction of one or more changes that are performed in the database.
- A transaction denotes any alteration performed in the database.
- A transaction can consist of five statuses
        1. Active - This is the initial state of a transaction, when it is being executed.
        2. Partial committed - It enters this stage when it is completing its final operations
        3. Failed - It enters this state when any checks made by the database recovery system fail.
        4. Aborted - A transaction enters this when the database recovery system check fails and the database rolls to its
                    original state before the transaction was committed.
        5. Committed - When all operations within a transaction have been successfully executed.

                    Uses of Transactions
- Transactions can be used to run a set of operations so that the database never contains a set of partial operations.
    If one operation fails, then the database is restored to its original state.
- Used to provide isolation between programs that access the database simultaneously.

                                AWS CLOUD ADOPTION FRAMEWORK.
- For an organisation to fully migrate its operations to the cloud, three aspects must be put into consideration.
    1. The people.
    2. Process
    3. Technology.
- The organisation must recognise its current state, target state and the transition needed to achieve the target
    state.
- AWS helps organisations develop efficient and effective plans for their cloud adoption journey.
- It breaks down complex processes of planning a move into manageable tasks known as perspectives.
- Perspectives represent special areas of focus that include:
    1. The people.
    2. Processes
    3. Technology.
- AWS organizes perspectives into six categories.
    1. Business.           4. Platform
    2. People.             5. Security
    3. Governance.         6. Operations.
- The first three are mainly concerned on business capabilities while the last three are mainly concerned
    with technical capabilities.

        Business Perspective.
- We must make sure that IT is properly aligned with its business needs.

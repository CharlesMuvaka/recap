                                            Angular Framework
- Angular can be written using Javascript, type script or Dart.
- Angular CLI(Command Line interface provides us the needed tools to perform a variety of tasks.) helps us to
    develop our application
- It consists of a set of commands that:
        1. Help us create a new application
        2. Build our application
        3. Serve our application.
- All angular commands begin with the prefix 'ng'.
- Some of the most commonly used commands include:
    1. ng new <app_name> - Used to create a new application
    2. ng build - It processes our application files and makes them ready for deployment.
    3. ng serve - This command lets us run our application in development mode hence helping
     us see how it looks like.

                                            Angular Framework
- Angular can be written using Javascript, type script or Dart.
- Angular CLI(Command Line interface provides us the needed tools to perform a variety of tasks.) helps us to
    develop our application
- It consists of a set of commands that:
        1. Help us create a new application
        2. Build our application
        3. Serve our application.
- All angular commands begin with the prefix 'ng'.
- Some of the most commonly used commands include:
    1. ng new <app_name> - Used to create a new application
    2. ng build - It processes our application files and makes them ready for deployment.
    3. ng serve - This command lets us run our application in development mode hence helping
     us see how it looks like.

                            Building Blocks of Angular
1. Angular CLI
2. Modules
3. Components
4. Metadata
5. Dependency Injection
6. Directives
7. Services
8. Data Binding
                                Modules
- Angular applications follow a modular structure. An application can consist of one or more modules each dedicated
    for a single purpose.
- Modules are also known as ngModules. These are classes denoted by the @ngModule decorator.
    NOTE: Decorators are functions that modify javascript classes. They are used to attach metadata to this classes
          denoting their configurations and how they should work.
- Each angular application must have a root module denoting the apps entry point.
- It is conventionally named as the AppModule, and it resides in the app.module.ts file.
- All other modules must be imported to the AppModule for them to work.

       The @NgModule Decorator
- It's a decorator function that takes in metadata objects whose properties describe the module.
- Some Metadata objects include:
        1. Declarations - These are classes that belong to the views that belong to this module. There are three type
                        of classes that belong to a view. Components, Directives and pipes.
        2. Exports - These are classes that should be accessible to the components of other modules.
        3. Imports - Other existing Modules whose classes are needed by the components of this module.
        4. Providers - Services present in one of the modules that should be used by other modules or components.
                NOTE: Once a service is included in the providers it becomes accessible to the whole application.
        5. Bootstrap - This metadata object is only found in the root module and it contains the component to be loaded.

  NOTE: The AppModule being the root module doesn't have exports as a metadata object since its main job is to
        import other modules.

                Components
- Angular puts everything in the user interface into self-contained components.
- A component controls one or more sections in the screen know as a view.
- We generate components easily using the angular CLI by typing the command, ng generate component <name_of_component>
- The command generates four other additional files.
            1. An HTML template that defines what to be rendered on the page.
            2. A CSS file that contains code for styling the page.
            3. A typescript file that defines the logic of the file.
            4. A testing specification file.

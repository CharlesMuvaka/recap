                        INTRODUCTION TO LINUX
 - Linux is an open source operating system(provides the source code of the operating system functionality).
    Linux Components
    1. Kernel -  A computer program at the core of the operating system that has complete control of
                everything in the operating system.
    2.Daemons - This is a computer program that runs as a back-ground processes
    3.Configuration files - Special type of files that store the initial settings or values of a computer
                            program.
                           - Use a common type of extension .conf, .cnf
    4. Applications -  A program aimed at performing a specific task.
    5. Data files - Contains information created by the user.
                   - They usually have a unique identifier.

                   LINUX USER_INTERFACE
    - One can interact with the operating system in two ways.
    1. Using Graphical User Interface -
    2. Using the Command-Line Interface - Interaction occurs through the shell(- a program that
        lets you type commands directly to the kernel)
        - Each shell has its own syntax and a way of formatting commands.
        Types
        1. The bash shell - The default shell for most linux operating systems
        2. The sh shell - The original shell for the unix Operating system( - operating system that linux
                        is built on.)
        3. The Ksh shell - The kornshell a common type of unix shell

                    LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS
       - A distro is a packaged version of linux ready to be used.
       1. Ubuntu
       2. KAli linux
       3. Fedora
       4. debian
       5. Red Hat
       6. Amazon Linux 2
                    CONNECTING TO A REMOTE SERVER
       - A secure shell is needed to connect to a remote server.
       - An SSH is a network protocol that enables a user to securely connect to another computer.
       - An ssh client is required to use an SSH.
       - Linux gives you access to the SSH client via the terminal.
       - SSH initiates connection using port 22.

       NOTE: Every Linux distribution instance comes in with a default user. E.g the Amazon Linux 2
            distro comes with an ec2 - default user.
            - To connect to this instance you need a private key that is automatically generated for you.

            LINUX LOGIN WORK FLOW
      - During the installation process, the user is prompted to create a default user(The root user).
      - The name should always be in lower case and is usually stored in the etc/passwd file.
      - A password is also prompted which is stored in the etc/shadow file.

            LINUX COMMAND PROMPT
      - Bash is the default shell for linux distros, it provides a command prompt - A text interface
        that enables a user to type commands directly to the kernel.
      - on init, the shell displays the user and the machine he is working on [user@computerName].

      - Most linux commands are case-sensitive and follow a common convention
       [command] [option] [argument]
      - The command is the instruction being executed on the kernel.
      - option is additional information on the command
      - argument is what the command is working on.

            COMMON USEFUL COMMANDS
      - whoami - prints out the current user in the machine.
      - id - command prints out the current id of the user and group id the user is involved in.
      - hostname - used to display or set the name of the system the user is working on.
      - uptime - prints out the duration the system has been on since the last boot.
      - date - prints out the current date
      - cal - prints a simple calendar indicating the month we are currently at
      - clear - used to clear the terminal screen
      - cat - used to read the contents of a file.
      - echo - used to print text on the terminal console.
      - touch - used to create a file inside a directory
      - history - prints out the list of commands that the user has typed.
      - mkdir - creates a directory.
      - cd - changes the directory that the user is in(cd .. - moves one step below your current directory
              cd muvaka - enters into a directory known as muvaka,
              cd - changes to the root directory of the user.)

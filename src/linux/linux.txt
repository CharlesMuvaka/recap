                        INTRODUCTION TO LINUX
 - Linux is an open source operating system(provides the source code of the operating system functionality).
    Linux Components
    1. Kernel -  A computer program at the core of the operating system that has complete control of
                everything in the operating system.
    2.Daemons - This is a computer program that runs as a back-ground process
    3.Configuration files - Special type of files that store the initial settings or values of a computer
                            program.
                           - Use a common type of extension .conf, .cnf
    4. Applications -  A program aimed at performing a specific task.
    5. Data files - Contains information created by the user.
                   - They usually have a unique identifier.

                   LINUX USER_INTERFACE
    - One can interact with the operating system in two ways.
    1. Using Graphical User Interface -
    2. Using the Command-Line Interface - Interaction occurs through the shell(- a program that
        lets you type commands directly to the kernel)
        - Each shell has its own syntax and a way of formatting commands.
        Types
        1. The bash shell - The default shell for most linux operating systems
        2. The sh shell - The original shell for the unix Operating system( - operating system that linux
                        is built on.)
        3. The Ksh shell - The kornshell a common type of unix shell

                    LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS
       - A distro is a packaged version of linux ready to be used.
       1. Ubuntu
       2. KAli linux
       3. Fedora
       4. debian
       5. Red Hat
       6. Amazon Linux 2
                    CONNECTING TO A REMOTE SERVER
       - A secure shell is needed to connect to a remote server.
       - An SSH is a network protocol that enables a user to securely connect to another computer.
       - An ssh client is required to use an SSH.
       - Linux gives you access to the SSH client via the terminal.
       - SSH initiates connection using port 22.

       NOTE: Every Linux distribution instance comes in with a default user. E.g the Amazon Linux 2
            distro comes with an ec2 - default user.
            - To connect to this instance you need a private key that is automaticaly generated for you.

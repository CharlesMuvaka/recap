                            NETWORKING
- A computer network is a group of computer devices connected to share resources
        Components
    - A computer - An electronic device connected to the network to share resources.
    - A Network Interface Cable - Connects a computer to a network cable
    - Ethernet cable - Connects a computer to a network via the NIC.
    - Switch - Connects multiple computers to a network
    - Router - Connects switches together.

        The OSI(Open System Interconnection) model
    - Defines a standard way in which computers can be connected to share resources.
    - It consists of 7 layers
    1. Application layer(Layer 7)
    2. Presentation
    3. Session
    4. Transport
    5. Network - Data is known as packets and is associated with an IP address.
    6. Data Link - Data is known as a frame, and it is associated with a MAC address
    7. Physical

  NOTE: Both MAC and IP addresses are used to identify computers in a network.
        The MAC address is issued by the vendor during the manufacture of a machine
        while the IP address is provided by the internet service provider.

  Networking Components
  1. Client - A computer device or program that sends requests to a server for resources.
  2. Server -  A computer that receives requests and sends responses to a client.
  3. Hub - Connects multiple computers together in a network. It doesn't send the data to a specific
            address, all computers receive the data thought the intended recipient is the only one
            that listens to the data.
  4. Switch - Connects multiple computers in a network and sends data to the intended computer using
              the mac address indicated.
       NOTE: The switch and the hub are both layer 2 devices
  5. Router - Connects multiple switches/ hubs together. It filters data and sends it to its
            intended destination. It operates both in layer 2 and 3. Can read data as a frame or a packet.

            Network Types
       1. Local Area Network
         - Connects devices on a small geographical area
       2. Wide Area Network
         - Connects devices on a large geographical area.
         - Uses fibre optics technologies and satellites to transmit data.
         NOTE: The internet is an example.

            Network Topologies
       - This refers to a pattern that shows how nodes are connected to each other
       - The pattern can be
                1. Physical topology - defines how devices are wired together.
                2. Logical topology -  refers to how data moves through the network.
                    NOTE: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud is an example of a logical topology that allows you to launch AWS
                    resources that you launch.
       - These topologies include
                1. Bus - All devices are connected together in a straight line. Usually slow since
                    a request has to go through another device before it reaches its end point.
                2. Mesh - A complex structure where devices are interconnected together. It maybe partial
                        or full. Partial, one device is connected to at least two devices while in a full mesh
                        all devices are interconnected together.
                3. Hybrid - A combination of two or more topologies, e.g the star-bus topology
                4. Star - Devices are connected to one central switch. Data sent from one device must pass through
                        the central switch before its send to its intended destination.


           Network Management
       - These define the roles of devices in a network
       - They consist of two types
       1. Client-server - Data management and application hosting is centralized in the server and Each device gets data from a server
       2. Peer-to-peer -  Each device has its own data and application and security and management of the data is upon the device.

            Network Protocols
       - A set of rules that define the formatting and transmission of data within a network.
       - They are found on Layer 3(Network) and Layer 4(Transport) of the OSI model.
       - They are of two types
            1. Connection less protocols -  Data transmission occurs without an established connection between the
                            two devices. Communication is in async.
            2. Connection oriented protocols - For data transmission to occur, the devices must establish a
                            connection. The transmission should be synchronous


            Internet Protocols(IP)
       - A set of rules and formatting that define communication over the internet.

            IP Address
       - A set of unique numbers that identifies a device communicating over the internet.
       - The internet uses this address to deliver data packets from a source to its destination.
       - Usually assigned by the internet service provider.
       - There are two types.
            1. Static IP addresses - They don't change once assigned to a device. Assigned to devices whose functions
                        are constant. Example printers, servers etc.
            2. Dynamic IP addresses - They change from time to time.
       - Internet protocols are applied in layer 3 of the OSI model.
       - They can be further be classified as:
            1. Private - They cannot be accessed via the internet.
            2. Public -  They can be accessed via the internet.

                    Common issues that can happen with IP addresses
            1. Latency - These are delays in data transfer. An application takes a long time to load. traceroute command can be used to check what
                        might be causing the latency. The command gives a report for the path the packet takes from the destination to its source.
                        NOTE: In this stage each server is known as a hop, and it checks for data loss as well.
            2. Server not responding to requests.

       REMEMBER: Layer 2(Data Link) establishes physical connection between two nodes  that use MAC Addresses using RG45 cables(Ethernet cables).Data
                 is also considered as a frame.

                 Layer 3(Network Layer) translates logical network addresses into physical addresses. It establishes how to deliver the message or break
                 it down if it's too large.
       - The Ip address serves in two purposes,
                1. Identify the host of the network.
                2. Identify the network itself.

                IPv4(Internet protocol version four)
- It is made up of 32 bits.
- Contains four numbers from 0 to 255 separated by periods each containing 8 bits. E.g 192.168.10.0

                IPv6(Internet protocol version six)
- It extends the range IPv4 addresses by a factor of 1,028. It uses a group of hexadecimal numbers that are separated by eight(8) colons.
- Advantages over IPv4
                1. Increases security.
                2. Improved performance.
                3. Handles packets more efficiently.


       SUBNETING
       - The process of subdividing your network into smaller segments.

       Importance
       - Reducing the amount of traffic in a network by redirecting data packets in this smaller
        networks that belong to the main network. Avoids collision of data packets.
       - Maximize the ability of IP addressing.
       - Provide administration of network security policies to this subnets.
